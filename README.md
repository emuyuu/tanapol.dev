A terminal-like portfolio website for myself with a seasoning of *neumorphism* design plus my favoirte Solarized color scheme!. The website is powered wonderful **Vue-cli**.

The code is *very very messy*. My excuse is I was just beginning to learn JavaScript, CSS, and Vue ðŸ˜‹.

Any advice suggestion, issue, or pull request are extremely welcomed!
